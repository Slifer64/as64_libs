- Training with multiple via points seems to learn the same covariance Sw in the following cases:
	i) either providing the gradient or not.
	   This is an additional indication that the gradient should be correct
	ii) with specific initialization, or just eye(n,n)
	   This is interesting, if indeed the Sw found is robust w.r.t the initial estimate! (must be further investigated)
	
	
- Enforcing strict non-zeroness of diag(L):
  Using L(i,i) = 1/ai
  so dJ/dL = Jx
  therefore dJ/dL(i,i) = Jx(i,i)
  so dJ/dai = dJ/dLii * dL(i,i)/dai = Jx(i,i) * (-L(i,i)^2)
  However, this lead to a Sw which did very poor generalization (even training with a single point and testing againts it)
